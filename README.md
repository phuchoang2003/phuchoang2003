# 👋 Hi, I'm Hoang Dinh Phuc

I'm a **SaaS builder and software engineer** focused on turning ideas into real, working products.

This GitHub is not a showcase of frameworks.
It’s a place where I **build systems**, test assumptions, and learn what actually matters when creating SaaS products.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

I’m currently focused on:

* Building **small but complete SaaS products**
* Going from idea → MVP → iteration
* Designing systems that can survive real users
* Learning by shipping, breaking, and fixing things

My long-term goal is to build sustainable SaaS businesses, not just side projects.

## 🧠 How I Think About Building SaaS

I believe good SaaS builders need to understand:

* Users and their real problems
* Product trade-offs, not just features
* Systems and constraints (cost, infra, maintenance)
* Enough code to own the product end-to-end

I care more about **clarity, simplicity, and progress** than chasing trends.

---

## 🛠 Background (Brief)

My background is primarily in **backend engineering**, where I’ve worked with:

* APIs and system design
* Databases and data modeling
* Deployment and production environments

I’m expanding into frontend and product UX to better own the full SaaS lifecycle.

(Tech details live inside the repos, not here.)

## ✍️ Learning in Public

I use GitHub as a logbook:

* Experiments that worked (and didn’t)
* Architecture decisions and trade-offs
* SaaS lessons learned the hard way

If something here looks unfinished, that’s intentional.
This is real work, not polished demos.
